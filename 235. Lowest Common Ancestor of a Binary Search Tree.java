// Link to the problem: https://leetcode.com/problems/lowest-common-ancestor-of-a-binary-search-tree/description/
// Problem:
// Given a binary search tree (BST), find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) node of two given nodes in the BST.
// According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes p and q as the lowest node in T that has both p and q as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).”

// Example 1:
// Input: root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5], p = 2, q = 8
// Output: 6
// Explanation: The LCA of nodes 2 and 8 is 6.

// Example 2:
// Input: root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5], p = 2, q = 4
// Output: 2
// Explanation: The LCA of nodes 2 and 4 is 2, since a node can be a descendant of itself according to the LCA definition.

// Example 3:
// Input: root = [2,1], p = 2, q = 1
// Output: 2
 

// Constraints:
// The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [2, 105].
// -109 <= Node.val <= 109
// All Node.val are unique.
// p != q
// p and q will exist in the BST.

// Solution:
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode(int x) { val = x; }
 * }
 */

class Solution {
    public TreeNode lowestCommonAncestor(TreeNode root, TreeNode p, TreeNode q) {

        TreeNode current = root;
        while (current != null) {
            // check if the given p and q is in the same subtree:
            // if so, continueing checking, otherwise, the current will be the common ancestor
            if (p.val > current.val && q.val > current.val) {
                current = current.right;
            } else if (p.val < current.val && q.val < current.val) {
                current = current.left;
            } else {
                break;
            }

        }

        return current;
        
    }
}
